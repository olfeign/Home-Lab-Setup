# Installation:  
I downloaded **VirtualBox** version 7.0.16 using the official [download site](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

# Configuration:  

- **Base Memory: 3/8GB (3072 MB):**  
  I initially set the memory to 2GB, however, based on the performance graphs **VirtualBox** provides, it was way too low and kept crashing the **VM**. This was a big concern as constant freezing and crashing could result in memory corruption and possibly the loss of important files and data.  

  For that, I have increased the memory to 3GB, which has solved the crashing issues for the most part, but is still unfortunately painfully slow.  

  I might increase memory by an additional 1GB to make it 4GB total, however, I am worried that this may throttle my host OS and cause crashing. I will see to it at a later time.

- **Processors: 3/8:**  
  The initial idea was to keep it at 2 processors only however that caused the OS to be extremely slow and unresponsive. To counter that, I decided to slightly increase it.  

  I decided to allocate 3 processors into the **VM** as adding more would throttle my laptop and increase the risk of freezes and crashes, which should be avoided at all costs.  

  I might experiment with adding an extra processor and see if it works out with no problems soon.

- **Potential Improvements:**  
  I am definitely limited with what I can do with this **VM** due to hardware constrictions, this list will not include any hardware-related upgrades as they are currently not feasible.  

  1. Try to allocate 4GB of RAM and see if I can run **VirtualBox** in a stable manner.  
  2. Try to allocate 4 processors and see if I can run **VirtualBox** in a stable manner.  
  3. Try different RAM and CPU allocations and see if I can run **VirtualBox** in a stable manner.
